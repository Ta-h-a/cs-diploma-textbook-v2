# Python program for `INTERSECTION method`

## Description

This Python code works with sets and demonstrates the concept of set intersection. It initializes two sets, 'set1' and 'set2,' and uses the intersection operation to create a new set containing elements that are common to both sets. Duplicate elements are automatically removed. The code illustrates the fundamental set operation of intersection.

## Code

```python title="program5c.py"
set1={'python','Java'}
set2={'C++','Java','pgmC','python'}
set=set1.intersection(set2)
print(set)
```

## Explanation of above code

- The Python code focuses on working with sets and demonstrates the concept of set intersection.
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements and support various set operations.
- The code initializes two sets, set1 and set2, using curly braces {}.
- set1 contains the elements 'python' and 'Java,' while set2 contains 'C++,' 'Java,' 'pgmC,' and 'python.'
- Sets automatically eliminate duplicate elements, so even if there are duplicates in the initialization, they will be stored as unique elements in the sets.
- The code employs the intersection method to perform the intersection operation on set1 and set2.
- Set intersection extracts elements that are common to both sets, creating a new set, which is also named set.
- To visualize the outcome of the intersection operation, the code uses the print function to display the contents of the set.
- The output will reveal all the elements that are common to both set1 and set2, without any duplicates.
- Set intersection is a fundamental set operation that extracts elements shared by two sets, often represented using the symbol âˆ© in set theory.
- In practical applications, set intersection is used in various scenarios, such as database queries, identifying common elements in datasets, and ensuring data integrity by checking for overlaps.
- When set1 and set2 are intersected, the result, stored in the variable set, contains all the elements that exist in both sets, helping identify common elements.
