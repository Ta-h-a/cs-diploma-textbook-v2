# Write a python program to perform `Arithmetic operations by Input function`

## Description

This Python code is a simple program that takes user input for two numbers, performs four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and displays the results with appropriate messages for each operation.

## Code

```python title="program2c.py"
x=int(input("Enter number1"))
y=int(input("Enter number2"))
sum=x+y
print("the sum is=",sum)
sub=x-y
print("the sub is=",sub)
multi=x*y
print("the multi is=",multi)
division=x/y
print("the division is=",division)
```

## Explanation of above code

- The Python code is a simple program designed to perform four basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers: x and y.
- It begins by utilizing the input function to collect user input for the values of x and y.
- These input values are subsequently converted into integers using the int function, ensuring they can be used for mathematical calculations.
- The program then proceeds to calculate and display the results of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- For each operation, the code provides a message indicating the specific operation being executed and the corresponding result.
- The user is presented with the sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division of the input numbers, offering a clear and interactive way to perform these calculations.
