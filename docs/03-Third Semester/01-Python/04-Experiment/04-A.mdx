# Execute and perform python program by using `Looping Statement`

## Description

This Python code generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number 'n.' It collects user input using the input function, then uses a for loop to calculate and display the product of 'n' with numbers from 1 to 10.

## Code

```python title="program4a.py"
n=int(input("Enter the number"))
for i in range(1,11):
    c=n*i
    print(n,"*",i,"=",c)
```

## Explanation of above code

- The Python code's purpose is to create a multiplication table for a user-specified number, denoted as 'n.'
- It initiates by using the input function to gather user input, representing the number for which the multiplication table will be generated.
- The code employs a 'for' loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive), using the 'range' function with the argument (1, 11).
- During each iteration, the program calculates the product of the user-defined number 'n' and the current value of 'i' and stores it in the variable 'c.'
- The code then prints each multiplication operation in the format 'n * i = c,' where 'n' represents the user-input number, 'i' represents the numbers from 1 to 10, and 'c' represents the result of the multiplication.
- For example, if the user enters 7 as 'n,' the code will generate and display the multiplication table for 7, showcasing the results of 7 multiplied by each integer from 1 to 10. This code provides a clear demonstration of using loops and basic arithmetic operations in Python to create multiplication tables for educational or practical purposes.
