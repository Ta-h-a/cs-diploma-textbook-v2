# Write a python program to perform `read` operation in FILE

## Description

The Python code reads the content of a text file, "file1.txt," and displays it in the console, illustrating the essential steps of file handling in Python.

## Code

```markdown title="file1.txt"
Hello Welcome to Python
Welcome to MLBP
Welcome to Computer Science Dept
(Type in notepad,and save as file1.txt or whatever name you want.)
```

```python title="index.py"
myfile=open("file1.txt","r")
print(myfile.read())
```

## Explanation of above code

- The provided Python code serves as a straightforward program for reading and displaying the contents of a text file named 'file1.txt.' Its functionality is summarized as follows:

### File Opening:

- The code commences by utilizing the 'open()' function to establish a connection with the 'file1.txt' in read mode. This operation creates a file object, and it is assigned to the variable 'myfile.'

### Reading File Content:

- The 'read()' method, employed on the 'myfile' file object, is called to retrieve the entire content of 'file1.txt' as a string. This method reads the text within the file, capturing it as a string.

### Console Output:

- Subsequently, the code employs the 'print' function to display the content of the file. Consequently, the text stored within 'file1.txt' is presented in the terminal or console.
- In essence, this code provides a basic illustration of how to read and present the contents of a text file in Python. Its execution entails opening the specified file, retrieving its content, and subsequently printing that content in the console for user observation.
