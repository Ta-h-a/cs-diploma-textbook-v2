## Explanation of above code

- `Starting HTML`: HTML is like a language that computers understand. Starting HTML is like saying 'Hey, let's create a webpage using this language.'
- `Starting the Main Content`: Once we've set up the structure, we start the main part where all the content goes, like the body of a letter.
- `Making Things Look Nice`: The `<font>` tag helps in styling the text, making it visually appealing. In this case, it's used to make the text larger for emphasis.
- `Writing the Heading`: The heading is like the title of a story or book, grabbing attention. The `<u>` and `<mark>` tags underline and highlight the heading to make it stand out.
- `Creating Lists`: Lists help organize information. The ordered list `<ol>` has items with numbers (a, b, c...), and the unordered list `<ul>` has items with bullet points.
- `Adding List Items`: Each `<li>` (list item) is a wish on our wish list. It's like writing down each item on a list, like items you need to buy at a store.
- `Displaying an Image`: Just like putting a picture in your storybook, the `<img>` tag displays an image. It helps convey an idea or a feeling related to the content.
- `Creating a Table`: The `<table>` tag is like creating a chart or a table in a document. It's a neat way to organize information, like listing challenges and opportunities side by side.
- `Closing HTML`: Just like how you say 'The end' at the end of a story, we close the HTML file. It's like putting a period at the end of a sentence. It tells the computer we're done.
