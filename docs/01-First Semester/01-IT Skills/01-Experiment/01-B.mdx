description: This algorithm is designed to subtract one number (n2) from another number (n1). It starts by declaring three containers (variables) to hold values - n1, n2, and diff. The user is prompted to input two numbers, which are stored in n1 and n2. The algorithm then subtracts n2 from n1 and stores the result in a variable called "diff". Finally, it displays the result of the subtraction (diff) to the user.

# Write an Algorithm to subtract two numbers

## Description

This algorithm is designed to subtract one number (n2) from another number (n1). It starts by declaring three containers (variables) to hold values: n1, n2, and diff. The user is prompted to input two numbers, which are stored in n1 and n2. The algorithm then subtracts n2 from n1 and stores the result in a variable called "diff". Finally, it displays the result of the subtraction (diff) to the user.

```markdown title="Algorithm"
Step 1 → START
Step 2 → Declare three variables n1, n2 and diff.
Step 3 → Read (input) two numbers and store in n1 & n2 respectively 
Step 4 → Subtract n1 & n2 and store result in diff i.e. diff = n1 - n2 
Step 5 → Display (output) result i.e. diff
Step 6 → STOP
```

## What does this mean ?

- Step 1: START. This marks the beginning of the algorithm.
- Step 2: Declare three variables n1, n2, and diff. These are containers to hold values.
- Step 3: Read (input) two numbers and store in n1 & n2 respectively. Get numbers from the user and store them in n1 and n2.
- Step 4: Subtract n1 and n2 and store the result in diff. Perform subtraction with the numbers in n1 and n2, and store the result in diff.
- Step 5: Display (output) the result, i.e., diff. Show the result to the user.
- Step 6: STOP. This marks the end of the algorithm.
