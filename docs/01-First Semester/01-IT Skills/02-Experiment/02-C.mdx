description: The flowchart outlines a step-by-step algorithm to find the smallest number among three input numbers, incorporating input validation for error handling. Beginning with the Start symbol, it proceeds to declare variables to hold the input numbers. The user is prompted to input three numbers, which are then validated for correctness. The algorithm compares the first two numbers and stores the smaller one. Following this, it compares the smallest to the third number, determining the overall smallest number among the three. Finally, it displays this smallest number to the user.

# Design a Flowchart to find Smallest of 3 numbers

## Description

The flowchart outlines a step-by-step algorithm to find the smallest number among three input numbers, incorporating input validation for error handling. Beginning with the Start symbol, it proceeds to declare variables to hold the input numbers. The user is prompted to input three numbers, which are then validated for correctness. The algorithm compares the first two numbers and stores the smaller one. Following this, it compares the smallest to the third number, determining the overall smallest number among the three. Finally, it displays this smallest number to the user.

## What does this mean ?

- `START` → The Start symbol indicates the beginning of the process.
- `VARIABLE DECLARATION` → This step is used to declare the three variables: n1, n2, and n3, which will store the three numbers for comparison.
- `USER INPUT PROMPT` → This step prompts the user to enter three numbers.
- `INPUT VALIDATION` → Here, the program validates the user's input to ensure it consists of three valid numbers and provides error handling if needed.
- `COMPARE FIRST TWO NUMBERS` → Compares the first two numbers (n1 and n2) and stores the smaller one in a variable called min.
- `COMPARE SMALLEST TO THIRD NUMBER` → Compares the smallest number (min) to the third number (n3) to determine the overall smallest number among the three.
- `DISPLAY OUTPUT` → The program displays the smallest number to the user.
