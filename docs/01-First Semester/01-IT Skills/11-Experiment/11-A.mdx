## Explanation of above code

### **Prog11.html**:

- **Header**: Displays "BUSINESS PROCESS AUTOMATION" in red, with a large font and a yellow text shadow.
- **Frames**:
  - `frame1.html`: Contains a table listing various engineering branches, including a link to "CS.html" targeting frame2.html.
  - `frame2.html`: Initially empty, meant to load content based on links from frame1.html.
- **Marquee**: Scrolls a message about the advantages of process automation for the Computer Science branch.

### **frame1.html**:

- **Content**: Displays a table showcasing different engineering branches.
- **Links**: Directs to specific HTML pages (CS.html and others) when clicked, targeting frame2.html.

### **frame2.html**:

-Initially blank, intended to display content loaded from links in frame1.html.

### **CS.html**:
