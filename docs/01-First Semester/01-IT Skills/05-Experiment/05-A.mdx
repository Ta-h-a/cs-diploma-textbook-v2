## Explanation of above code

- `Starting HTML`: Imagine HTML is like a language computers understand. When we start an HTML file, it's like saying to the computer, 'Hey, get ready, we're going to talk in HTML now.'
- `Setting Up the Document`: It's like when you're writing a letter. You want to set up the basics first. The `<head>` part is where you put important information about your 'letter,' like a title. It's like writing the recipient's address on an envelope. The `<title>` is like giving your letter a title, so people know what it's about before they open it.
- `Starting the Main Content`: Now, let's dive into the body of the letter. The `<body>` is where the main content of your letter goes, just like the main part of the letter you're writing.
- `Making Things Look Nice`: Sometimes, you want your letter to look neat and organized. The `<center>` tag is like saying, 'Let's make everything nice and centered on the page, so it looks clean and tidy.'
- `Writing the Heading`: When you write a letter, you often start with a big, important title. The `<h1>` tag is like that - it's saying, 'This is the big, important part.' And using `<mark>` and `<u>` is like highlighting and underlining the title to make it even more noticeable.
- `Styling the Text`: You know how you use different styles when you write, like making words slanted or changing their size? The `<i>` tag is like saying, 'Let's slant this part, like we're whispering it.' And the `<font>` tag is like choosing how big, what color, and what font style you want for that part of the text.
- `Adding Emphasis`: Sometimes, you want to say something extra loud or strong in your letter. The `<b>` tag is like using bold letters to make a point, saying, 'Pay attention to this!'
- `Writing the Poem`: Now, let's get into the heart of the letter, where you tell your story. In this case, it's a poem. You use different styles to make it interesting, just like using different voices or expressions when you tell a story to make it more exciting.
- `Ending the Letter`: Like ending a letter with your name, here we have a line that tells us who wrote the poem. It's like saying, 'This awesome poem was created by XYZ.'
- `Closing HTML`: Finally, just like you finish a letter with 'Sincerely' or 'Best regards,' we end our HTML file by saying, 'Okay, we're done with the whole thing. The end!'
