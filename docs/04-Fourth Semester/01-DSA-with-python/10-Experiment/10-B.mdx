# Implement Priority Queue

## Description

The code utilizes the PriorityQueue class from the queue module to implement a priority queue. Elements are added to the queue based on their priority and retrieved in the order of their priority.


## Code

```python title="expt10b.py"
import queue
q = queue.PriorityQueue()
q.put(10)
q.put(60)
q.put(20)
q.put(110)
q.put(40)
print(q.get())
print(q.get())
print(q.get())
print(q.get())
print(q.get())
```

## Explanation of above code

- The given code demonstrates the use of the PriorityQueue class from the queue module in Python. A priority queue is a data structure where each element has a priority associated with it. Elements are retrieved in the order of their priority, with the highest priority element being dequeued first.

### Code Explanation

- The code begins by importing the queue module, which provides the PriorityQueue class for implementing a priority queue.
- A priority queue object q is created using the PriorityQueue() constructor.
- Elements are added to the priority queue using the put() method, which inserts elements based on their priority.
- The elements are retrieved from the priority queue using the get() method, which dequeues elements in the order of their priority. The retrieved elements are printed using the print() function.
- This code demonstrates the usage of the PriorityQueue class to implement a priority queue and retrieve elements based on their priority.
