# Implement Bracket matching using stack.

## Description

The checkBalance function uses a stack-based approach to check if an expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced, returning True if it is and False otherwise.

## Code

```python title="program8b.py"
def checkBalance(expr):
    stack = []
    for char in expr:
        if char in ["(", "{", "["]:
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            if not stack:
                return False
            currChar = stack.pop()
            if currChar == "(":
                if char != ")":
                    return False
            if currChar == "{":
                if char != "}":
                    return False
            if currChar == "[":
                if char != "]":
                    return False
    if stack:
        return False
    return True

expr = "{{[()]}}"
if checkBalance(expr):
    print("The given string is balanced")
else:
    print("The given string is not balanced")
```

## Explanation of above code

### checkBalance Function
- The checkBalance function checks if a given expression expr containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and ensures that the closing symbols match the corresponding opening symbols.
#### Stack Initialization
- The stack is initialized as an empty list.
#### Iterating Over Characters
- The function iterates over each character char in the expr string.
#### Opening Symbols
- If the character char is an opening symbol (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), it is pushed onto the stack using the append method.
#### Closing Symbols
- If the character char is a closing symbol, the function performs the following checks:
- If the stack is empty (i.e., there are no corresponding opening symbols for the current closing symbol), it means the expression is unbalanced. In this case, the function returns False.
- If the stack is not empty, it pops the top character currChar from the stack using the pop method.
- It then checks if currChar matches the expected closing symbol for the current character char.
- If they don't match, it means the expression is unbalanced, and the function returns False.
#### Final Check
- After iterating through all the characters in the expression, the function performs a final check:
- If there are remaining opening symbols in the stack (i.e., the stack is not empty), it means the expression is unbalanced. In this case, the function returns False.
- If the stack is empty, it means all opening and closing symbols are properly balanced, and the function returns True.
### Main Code
- In the main code, a string expr is defined, representing the expression to be checked for balanced parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.
- The checkBalance function is called with expr as an argument.
- If the function returns True, it means the expression is balanced, and the message "The given string is balanced" is printed.
- If the function returns False, it means the expression is unbalanced, and the message "The given string is not balanced" is printed.
- This code allows you to check whether a given expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced or not using a stack-based approach. It ensures that opening and closing symbols are properly matched in the expression.
