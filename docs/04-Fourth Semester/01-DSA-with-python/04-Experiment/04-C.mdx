# Implement Fibonacci sequence with dynamic programming.

## Description

The code calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number `n` and returns the sequence as a list. It uses a `for` loop to generate the Fibonacci numbers and appends them to a list. The function is then called with different values of `n` to print the corresponding Fibonacci sequences.

## Code

```python title="program4c.py"
def fib(n):
    a = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        a.append(a[i-1] + a[i-2])
    return a

print(fib(2))
print(fib(3))
print(fib(5))
print(fib(6))s
print(fib(7))
print(fib(8))
```

## Explanation of above code
### Function Definition:
- The code defines a function called fib that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given input n.
- The function takes a single parameter n, which represents the number of Fibonacci sequence elements to generate.
- The function will return a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element.
- Fibonacci Sequence Initialization:
- Inside the function, a list named a is initialized with the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1].
- a[0] represents the 0th Fibonacci number (0) and a[1] represents the 1st Fibonacci number (1).
- Fibonacci Sequence Calculation:
- A for loop is used to calculate the remaining Fibonacci numbers up to the nth element.
- The loop starts from 2 and goes up to n+1 (inclusive).
- In each iteration, the next Fibonacci number is calculated by summing the previous two numbers in the sequence (a[i-1] and a[i-2]).
- The newly calculated Fibonacci number is then appended to the a list using the append method.
- Return the Fibonacci Sequence:
- Once the loop completes, the function returns the a list, which contains the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element.
### Testing the Function:
- The print statements at the end of the code call the fib function with different values of n to test its functionality.
- The function is called with n equal to 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- The returned Fibonacci sequences are printed, and the output will be:
```text title="Output"
[0, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 2]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
```
- In summary, the code defines a function fib that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.
- The Fibonacci sequence is calculated using a for loop and stored in a list, which is then returned by the function.
- The code demonstrates the functionality of the fib function by printing Fibonacci sequences for different values of n.
